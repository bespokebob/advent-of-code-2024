# advent-of-code-2024

[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions.

Each script is essentially throw-away code used to solve each day's problems
(part 1 and 2 in the same script) and print the answers. You won't find much
re-usable code or good practices, but I tried to leave some comments explaining
each step in the solution, which should help if you're stuck.

## Running the solutions

- [Install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
- Run scripts with `deno run --allow-read` (or just execute them directly)
- Run with a `test` argument to use test input (included), or without arguments
  to use your own `input.txt` file (not included).
