# advent-of-code-2024

[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions.

Each script is essentially throw-away code used to solve each day's problems
(part 1 and 2 in the same script) and print the answers. You won't find much
re-usable code or good practices, but I tried to leave some comments explaining
each step in the solution, which should help if you're stuck.

## Running the solutions

- [Install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
- Run scripts with `deno run --allow-read` (or just execute them directly)
- Scripts run with test input; edit the file to replace the `input.test.txt`
  with the path to your own input if you want to get your own answers.
